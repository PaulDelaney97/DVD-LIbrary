# DVD-LIbrary

This is a DVD Library console application I created for an assingment on Mthree's training program. The program follows the MVC pattern and demonstrates an understanding of OOPS concepts: Classes and Objects, Inheritance, Interfaces, Dependency Injection and loosely-coupled code. It also demonstrates an understanding of data marshalling. The library is read and written to a txt file.
